      "q1_statement": "The foundations of cloud computing are high-powered computers called servers, located in facilities called data centers.",
      "q1_explanation": "That's right! The cloud's central innovation is placing large numbers of servers in data centers, typically located far from the individuals and organizations that access them.",
      "q2_statement": "Cloud computing requires organizations to buy and operate their own computer equipment on-premises.",
      "q2_explanation": "Exactly. Historically, organizations operated their own on-premises equipment. Cloud computing allows them to access resources remotely from a cloud provider instead."

    "examples": {
      "ex1_text": "Paying for storage space that automatically scales to match the amount of data in use.",
      "ex1_explanation": "You got it. Scalable storage is a core component of infrastructure that you rent from a provider. This is a classic IaaS offering.",
      "ex1_hint_paas": "While a PaaS application would *use* storage, the storage service itself is a more fundamental building block. It's part of the core infrastructure.",
      "ex1_hint_saas": "This isn't a complete application, but a raw component you'd use to build one. Which model provides these fundamental building blocks?",
      "ex2_text": "Using Zoom for video calls or Slack for messaging.",
      "ex2_explanation": "That's it! These are examples of complete software products that you access, typically by paying a subscription. This is Software as a Service.",
      "ex2_hint_iaas": "With Zoom or Slack, are you managing servers or just using an app? IaaS is about renting the servers themselves. This is a level above that.",
      "ex2_hint_paas": "PaaS is a platform for developers to *create* apps. Zoom is an app that has already been created for you to use. Which model fits that description?",
      "ex3_text": "Operating your own software in the cloud while a provider handles and maintains the servers.",
      "ex3_explanation": "Perfect! With PaaS, you focus on your application code, while the provider handles the underlying infrastructure and technical responsibilities, like server maintenance.",
      "ex3_hint_iaas": "You're getting warmer! IaaS would give you the server, but you would be responsible for maintaining it. This service handles that maintenance for you.",
      "ex3_hint_saas": "This is a model for *running* your own software, not for *using* someone else's. Which category provides that kind of platform?",
      "ex4_text": "Accessing a file sharing service to collaborate with a team.",
      "ex4_explanation": "Correct! A file sharing service is a ready-to-use application provided for end-users, which is the definition of SaaS.",
      "ex4_hint_iaas": "File sharing is a feature of a complete software product. IaaS would be renting the raw storage where those files are kept.",
      "ex4_hint_paas": "You are *using* a finished service, not *building* one. PaaS is the environment for building. What's the model for using?",
      "ex5_text": "Using a provider's infrastructure for large-scale data processing and analytics.",
      "ex5_explanation": "Exactly! You are renting the provider's fundamental computing resources (their infrastructure) to perform complex tasks. This is IaaS.",
      "ex5_hint_paas": "PaaS provides a managed platform, but when you're directly utilizing raw processing power and storage for custom analytics, you're using the underlying infrastructure.",
      "ex5_hint_saas": "This describes using core computing power, not a specific, pre-built software application. Which model is about renting raw resources?",
      "ex6_text": "Hosting your company's custom application and its business analytics tools.",
      "ex6_explanation": "That's right. When you deploy and run your own software and tools on a managed environment from a cloud provider, that's Platform as a Service.",
      "ex6_hint_iaas": "You could do this with IaaS, but you'd also have to manage the operating systems and servers. PaaS handles that for you so you can focus on your app.",
      "ex6_hint_saas": "This is about running your *own* custom application, not subscribing to one made by someone else. Which model provides a platform for your own software?",
      "default_hint": "That doesn't seem to be the right fit. Think about the level of management provided by the service."

      "q1_scenario": "A financial firm needs to store proprietary research with greater security, requiring an encrypted VPN connection for its employees to access it.",
      "q1_explanation": "A Private Cloud is ideal here. It offers the greatest security by imposing more restrictions on access, making it suitable for sensitive information like financial records or proprietary research.",
      "q2_scenario": "A software company wants to deploy its app for nearly any customer to use, with easy access over standard internet connections and lower costs.",
      "q2_explanation": "A Public Cloud is the perfect choice. They are called 'public' because nearly any customer can pay to use their servers, making them cheaper and offering easy access.",
      "q3_scenario": "A company runs its videoconferencing software on a public cloud but stores its sensitive customer service records in a separate, more secure environment.",
      "q3_explanation": "This is a classic Hybrid Cloud. This model involves splitting data and applications across public and private clouds to combine the benefits of both.",
      "default_explanation": "That's a good thought, but there's a better fit. Consider the key requirements of the scenario."
