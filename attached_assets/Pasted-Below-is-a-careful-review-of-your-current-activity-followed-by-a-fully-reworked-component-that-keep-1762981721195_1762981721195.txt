Below is a careful review of your current activity, followed by a fully reworked component that keeps the same general idea but makes the learning goals clearer, the trade‑offs explicit, and the scoring more principled. I’ve focused on accuracy for beginners, transparency of “why,” and side‑by‑side comparisons so learners see options rather than just a single “right” answer.

Quick review of your current version (what’s good / what to improve)

What’s already strong

Clear, attractive UI with a scenario → choose → evaluate loop that’s easy to follow.

Simple cost/performance visualization that gives immediate feedback.

Uses scenarios (great for anchoring abstract cloud concepts to real situations).

Where it can be clearer / more accurate

Cost model mixes concerns: service model is treated as a multiplier on deployment cost; in practice, infra costs (public/private/hybrid) and platform/license/ops costs (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) are distinct. This can mislead learners. 

Part5CloudDesigner

Performance logic is oversimplified (e.g., public = excellent near max users) and isn’t tied to elasticity or capacity planning, which are the actual drivers newbies need to grasp. 

Part5CloudDesigner

Feedback & scoring are opaque: “ideal” is hard‑coded per scenario; learners don’t see why a choice is better or how it ranks against alternatives. 

Part5CloudDesigner

SaaS vs building apps: some scenarios where a user builds a custom app make SaaS conceptually “not applicable,” but the activity currently treats SaaS like just another knob.

Internationalization coupling: relying on FormattedMessage IDs here makes the pedagogical logic harder to read/maintain; the activity is simpler with inline text and optional i18n hooks.

What the revised version does differently

Separates the two decisions clearly

Service model (IaaS / PaaS / SaaS) affects operational effort, control, time‑to‑market, lock‑in.

Deployment model (Public / Private / Hybrid) affects elasticity/scale, base infra cost, compliance posture.

Makes four trade‑off dimensions explicit

Cost ($/mo), Scale & Performance, Compliance & Control, Operational Effort (lower effort = better for small teams).
Learners see all four as bars, and a weighted Fit Score per scenario.

Compares all combinations

A “Compare all options” table shows every Service × Deployment combo ranked for the current scenario and user count, so trade‑offs are visible, not hidden.

Transparent scoring & feedback

The “Evaluate” step tells learners why their pick is strong/weak relative to the top recommendation(s), and which factors helped or hurt.

More realistic (but still simple) models

Cost = infra cost (by deployment) + ops/platform cost (by service) — not a single multiplier.

Performance/Scale aligns with elasticity and whether you’re pushing capacity.

Compliance & Control improves with Private/Hybrid and with IaaS (more control), but may decrease with SaaS (less control/customization).

Operational Effort is highest on IaaS, lowest on SaaS, medium on PaaS.

Drop‑in replacement: Part5CloudDesignerV2.tsx

Notes

Keeps your onComplete(score: number) contract.

Uses Tailwind like your original.

All strings are inline for clarity (easy to swap to react-intl later).

Scenarios are beginner‑friendly and map to when SaaS vs build‑your‑own makes sense.
