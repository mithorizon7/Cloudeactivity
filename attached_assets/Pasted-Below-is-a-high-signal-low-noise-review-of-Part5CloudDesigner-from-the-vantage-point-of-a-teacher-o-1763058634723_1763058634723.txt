Below is a high‑signal, low‑noise review of Part5CloudDesigner from the vantage point of a teacher optimizing for effectiveness, usefulness, accessibility, and insight—without making it overwhelming. I’ve ordered the recommendations by importance and impact. I ground content choices in the same articles your learners read so the activity reinforces, not contradicts, those texts.

Quick verdict (for orientation)
* What’s excellent: authentic trade‑off thinking; simple knobs (service, deployment, users); immediate feedback; i18n‑ready copy; a transparent comparison table when learners want detail. 
* What’s holding it back for true novices: too many levers visible at once; domain terms (“elasticity,” “compliance,” “lock‑in”) appear before definition; “numbers” feel untethered to the articles; cognitive load spikes when the full 3×3 table is on by default. 

Tier 1 — Essentials that most improve learning outcomes
1. Sequence the challenge: start simple, then add complexity. Reorder scenarios so learners first face the SaaS‑friendly case (your Scenario 3), then a cost/performance public‑cloud case (Scenario 1), then the compliance‑heavy case (Scenario 2). This mirrors the articles’ “SaaS → PaaS/IaaS → public/private/hybrid” mental ladder and reduces early overwhelm.
2. Give a 20‑second mental model before choices. Add a one‑paragraph primer at the top (collapsible) with three bullets learners just read about:
    * Servers in data centers do the heavy lifting (that’s “the cloud”). 
    * Service models: IaaS (rent infrastructure), PaaS (run your software on their platform), SaaS (use their software). 
    * Deployment models: public (multi‑tenant), private (single‑tenant), hybrid (mix). 
3. Default to “details‑on‑demand”: hide the big comparison table initially. Today the table is visible by default (setShowCompare(true)), which invites comparison paralysis. Flip the default to hidden with a “Show how all 9 options score” button; keep only the Top 3 visible inline. This preserves insight and agency without the noise. 
4. Inline definitions at point of need (chips/tooltips). Add tiny “?” help chips next to Cost, Performance, Compliance, Effort, Elasticity, Lock‑in with 1‑line, article‑consistent definitions. Example: “Elasticity: how easily resources scale up/down across data centers.” (Articles emphasize scaling and remote servers.) 
5. Align the activity’s narrative with the articles’ canonical framing. In the scenario copy, explicitly name how SaaS/PaaS/IaaS differ in who runs what and why learners might pick each. The explainer explicitly uses Netflix to show PaaS for the provider vs SaaS for users—re‑use that framing in your micro‑explanations so learners don’t invent their own definitions. 
6. Add a sustainability call‑out where it belongs (one sentence, neutral). Next to Deployment (public/private/hybrid), surface one sentence: “Large public clouds often run in hyperscale data centers that concentrate efficiency—but all data centers consume significant electricity and cooling water; impact depends on grid mix and cooling approach.” This ties decisions to the sustainability article without turning the screen into an ethics seminar. 

Tier 2 — Make feedback more teachable (short, targeted upgrades)
1. Explain “fit” in plain language and show how it’s computed. Add a small “How we computed this” expander: “Fit = weighted blend of affordability, performance, compliance, ease.” Show the weights from the current scenario (“Cost 30%, Performance 35%…”). You already have weights; display them and a 1‑line reason per scenario. This makes the scoring feel fair and demystified. 
2. Rename metrics for novices + add units everywhere.
    * “Ease” → “Operational effort (lower is better)” or keep “Ease” but clarify with a tooltip.
    * Add “USD/month” to all costs and “per 1,000 users” to variable costs; right now variablePerKUsers shows a bare number. Units reduce misinterpretations. 
3. Make “why your pick is good/bad” crisper. Your getFeedback() produces “helping/hurting” lists; add one line for each hurt with a specific remedy (“If compliance is low, consider private or hybrid and IaaS/PaaS for more control”). That maps directly to the public/private/hybrid discussion in the article. 

Tier 3 — Accessibility and cognitive‑load polish
1. Use radio‑group semantics for the option lists. The service and deployment selectors behave like single‑choice radios but are implemented as buttons with aria-pressed. Wrap them in role="radiogroup" and each option as role="radio" with aria-checked—or keep buttons and add keyboard arrow navigation and roving tabindex. This reduces cognitive friction for keyboard and screen‑reader users. 
2. Clarify heading hierarchy and focus order. Ensure a single <h1> (title), then <h2> for “Scenario,” “Choose service,” “Choose deployment,” “Trade‑offs,” “Compare options.” After Evaluate, send focus to the feedback region so assistive tech announces the result. 

Tier 4 — Pedagogical richness without extra noise
1. Anchor the scenarios to realities in the readings.
* Scenario A (start here): “Small team adopting a collaboration tool” → SaaS is applicable; public cloud; why that’s low effort and fast to update. 
* Scenario B: “Streaming‑like service” → PaaS/IaaS + public shines for scaling; tie to how data centers distribute workloads. 
* Scenario C (compliance): “Health data web app” → hybrid/private likely; mention why some workloads stay private.  Consider a short “Impact example” link to Philips Pregnancy+ to show how cloud helps low‑storage phones access a huge library—high societal value, makes the abstraction vivid. 

Tier 5 — Light code/logic improvements that boost trust
1. Make cost math transparent in the UI. You already compute infraCost = fixedInfra + (users/1000)*variablePerKUsers and add monthlyOpsOverhead from the service choice. Show that equation in a tooltip next to “Cost,” with the numbers plugged in (rounded). Transparency increases perceived fairness and teaches TCO thinking. 
2. Clarify directionality in the rubric. In weightedFit, “Effort” currently adds m.ease (higher is better). Label it Ease (higher=less effort) in UI to avoid confusion. 
3. Tune thresholds in feedback. Today, performance “helping” triggers at ≥75 and “hurting” at <60. Make these revealable in a “Why did I get this?” expander so learners don’t see the system as arbitrary. 
4. Prefer currency formatting everywhere. Use FormattedNumber with style currency in pill labels and table cells (including variablePerKUsers plus “/1,000 users”). This prevents unit drift. 

Minimal copy blocks to drop in (article‑aligned)
* Top primer (collapsible): “Cloud computing means remote servers in data centers handle storage and processing. You access those resources over the internet. Service models differ by who runs what: IaaS (rent servers), PaaS (run your app on the provider’s platform), SaaS (use their app).”
* Deployment tooltips:
    * Public: multi‑tenant data centers; easy access; often cheapest for scale. 
    * Private: single‑tenant; higher control, higher fixed cost. 
    * Hybrid: mix; connect sensitive data privately and scale public workloads. 
* Impact example link text: “Pregnancy+: Cloud hosting delivers a huge multilingual library and rich 3D visuals to low‑storage phones; updates reach everyone at once.” 

Why these changes hit the “sweet spot”
* They lower cognitive load (hide the 9‑way table; define terms at point‑of‑use; reorder scenarios). 
* They heighten educational potency (explicit ties to service/deployment models, scaling, and sustainability exactly as taught in the readings).
* They preserve engagement (transparent scoring, top‑3 leaderboard feel, short reflection). 

Implementation checklist (teacher‑friendly, in order)
1. Switch scenario order to SaaS → scaling → compliance; update scenario text accordingly. 
2. Add the top primer and the definitions chips for metrics and models.
3. Hide the big table by default; show Top 3 inline; keep “Show all 9” as an option. 
4. Expose the fit formula and weights; add one‑line scenario rationale. 
5. Convert service/deployment pickers to a proper radio group or add arrow‑key handling; tidy focus order. 
6. Add units to all cost surfaces and clarify “Ease (less effort).” 
7. Add the one‑click reflection prompt after Evaluate; leave comparison optional.
