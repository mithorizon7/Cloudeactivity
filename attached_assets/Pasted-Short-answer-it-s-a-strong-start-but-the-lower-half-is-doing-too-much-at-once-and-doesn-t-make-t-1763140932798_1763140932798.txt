Short answer: it’s a strong start, but the lower half is doing *too much at once* and doesn’t make the “learning path” or the meaning of the numbers obvious. I’d fix that by (1) reshaping the flow into a clear stepper, (2) making “your current design” and its trade-offs visually dominant, and (3) turning the dense table + help text into something more progressive and visual.

I’ll go section by section, with specific changes your dev/designer can implement.

---

## 1. Make the whole thing a clear 4-step flow

Right now the page *says* there are 4 steps, but visually everything is just open and competing for attention.

**Change: treat each numbered step as a collapsible “step card” with a clear progress state.**

* **Step 1 – Service Model card**
* **Step 2 – Deployment Model card**
* **Step 3 – Active Users card**
* **Step 4 – See trade-offs & evaluate card**

**Implementation details:**

* Each step card has:

  * A header bar: `1 · Choose a Service Model` with a small subtitle `What you buy`.
  * A progress state: `Not started / In progress / Done` (simple icon + label).
* When the learner makes a selection for a step:

  * Mark the step as “Done”.
  * Briefly highlight the next step header (subtle glow, arrow, etc.) and auto-scroll just enough to bring it into view.
* On initial load:

  * Only Step 1 is fully expanded.
  * Step 2–4 show just headers + 1 line of explanation; expand when the learner reaches them.

**Why:** This reduces initial cognitive load and reinforces the pedagogical structure: “First choose *what you buy*, then *where it runs*, then *how big it is*, then *see trade-offs*.”

---

## 2. Unify the “Users” concept and move it up

Currently you have:

* A `Users: 3,000` pill in the scenario header.
* A “3) Adjust Active Users” slider at the very bottom.

That’s one concept split across the screen.

**Change: make “Active users” a single, obvious control tied to the scenario.**

* Move the slider into the **scenario card**, right under the description.
* Replace the floating `Users: 3,000` pill with:

  * Label: `Active users`
  * Slider: `500 ———— 10,000`
  * Value readout on the right: `3,000 users`
* Then Step 3 can just say:

  > **3 · Check how your design behaves at different user counts**
  > (We’ll use the slider in the scenario above.)

Or, alternatively, keep Step 3 but it just points directly to that control instead of having a separate card.

**Why:** It reinforces that “size of the org” is a *scenario attribute*, not a random extra control. It also tightens the relationship between text (“~500–5,000 employees”) and the slider.

---

## 3. Rethink the trade-offs table as a “design scoreboard”

Right now the “4) See Trade-offs” section is essentially a mini spreadsheet:

* 9 rows (all combos)
* 4 numeric columns
* A footnote explaining Fit

For non-technical learners, this screams “homework,” and it doesn’t visually convey *why* their choice is good or bad.

**Goal:** Turn this into a **scoreboard for *their* current design**, with the full table as an optional “nerd mode.”

### 3.1. Above the table: “Your current design”

At the top of Step 4, before the big table, show a compact, highly visual summary:

> **Your current design**
> SaaS (use an existing product) · Public Cloud · 3,000 users
>
> Overall Fit: **82 / 100** (Good fit for this scenario)
>
> * Cost: **$1,340/mo** – ★★★★☆ (High savings)
> * Speed & Scale: **88 / 100** – ★★★★☆
> * Compliance: **64 / 100** – ★★☆☆☆ (OK, but not ideal)
> * Operational effort: **80 / 100** – ★★★★☆

Visually, that can be:

* One big horizontal bar labeled `Overall fit` (0–100), filled proportionally.
* Four smaller bars (or meter chips) for Cost, Perf, Compliance, Ease, with short plain-English labels (“cheap / moderate / expensive”).

### 3.2. Below that: “Compare with alternatives”

The full 9-row table is still useful, but it should feel like *optional analysis*, not the primary UI.

* Add a small toggle at the top:
  `View: [ Summary ] [ All options ]`
* Default to **Summary** (your current design + the top 2 alternatives).
* In **All options** view:

  * Add a “Fit” column as the first column with a clear bar or number.
  * Allow **sorting by column**: Fit (default), Cost, Perf, Compliance, Ease.
  * Visually highlight:

    * The learner’s current choice row (subtle background).
    * The best-fit row (a “Recommended” tag).
  * Greyscale or slightly de-emphasize the lower-ranked rows so the top 3 stand out.

**Why:** Learners aren’t here to parse nine Excel rows; they’re here to understand “Is my design good for this scenario, and why?” The scoreboard and comparison framing teach that much faster.

## 4. Make “Quick Refresher” lighter and more contextual

The “Quick Refresher” panel on the right is useful, but right now:

* It’s big and text-heavy.
* It looks like something you *must* read to proceed.

**Changes:**

1. **Shrink and lighten:**

   * Rename to something more optional, e.g. `Need a quick refresher?`
   * Replace the bullet list with 3–4 short Q&A-style chips:

     * “What is cloud computing?”
     * “What’s the difference between IaaS / PaaS / SaaS?”
     * “What are deployment models?”

   Clicking a chip opens a *short* popover or side drawer with the explanation.

2. **Behavior across scenarios:**

   * For Scenario 1, keep it expanded by default.
   * Once the learner closes it, remember that preference and start collapsed on Scenarios 2 and 3.

**Why:** It stays findable for people who are lost, but it stops competing with the main decision-making UI.

---

## 5. Clarify visual affordances & selection states

You’re already using cards nicely for IaaS/PaaS/SaaS and for deployment models, but from the screenshot it’s not crystal-clear what is selected versus not.

**Changes:**

* When a card is selected:

  * Stronger border and subtle glow.
  * Small checkmark in the top right (`Selected`).
* On hover:

  * Slight vertical lift and shadow.
* In the trade-offs section:

  * Show the chosen Service + Deployment at the top (“Your current design”, as above).
* Consider showing a tiny summary under each selected card:

  * For IaaS: “Best when you want full control and have an ops team.”
  * For SaaS: “Best when you want a quick solution and can accept less customization.”

**Why:** Beginner learners need “this is the one I picked” to be unmistakable.

---

## 6. Reduce local clutter and repetition

A few specific clean-ups:

1. **Headers & subtitles**

   * You have a lot of stacked text in card headers:
     `1) Choose a Service Model for this scenario`
     `(what you buy)`
     `IaaS (build & run VMs/containers)`
     `You manage OS/runtime and scaling...`
   * Compress and standardize:

     * Card header: `1 · Choose a Service Model`
       Subtitle: `What you buy`
     * Inside card:

       * Title: `IaaS`
       * Tagline: `Build & run VMs/containers`
       * Description: 1–2 short sentences.

2. **Metric badges in the Service Model cards**

   * Right now “Ops overhead $6,000/mo” + “Lock-in: low” live at the bottom with circular `?` icons.
   * Put them in a **two-column row** with clearer labels:

     * `Ops effort: $6,000/mo ?`
     * `Vendor lock-in: Low ?`
   * Use icons + text, not just pills, so learners can scan differences across cards.

3. **Deployment model metrics**

   * Make it explicit which direction is “good”:

     * `Fixed cost: $0/mo (lower is better)`
     * `Cost per 1K users: $180/1k (lower is better)`
     * `Scale: 90/100 (higher is better)`
   * You can encode this visually by:

     * Using small arrows ↑ / ↓ plus color intensity.
     * Or a simple “Good / OK / Weak” label.

**Why:** Every time you can remove a sentence or clarify “which direction is better,” you reduce friction in making the decision.

---

## 7. Tie the bottom buttons to learning outcomes

At the bottom you’ve got:

* `Evaluate my choice`
* `Next scenario`

I’d strengthen these as pedagogical affordances:

* `Evaluate my choice` → open a side panel or overlay that:

  * Restates their design and the scenario priorities.
  * Explicitly explains why the fit score is what it is, in words.
  * Calls out 1–2 alternative designs and *what trade-off they’d be making* to switch.
* Disable `Next scenario` until they’ve hit `Evaluate my choice` at least once (or gently nudge them: “Evaluate your choice to see feedback before moving on.”)

**Why:** “Evaluate” becomes the formative feedback step, not just a generic button.

---

## 8. Small visual polish items

Rapid-fire items your designer can tune:

* Increase vertical spacing between major sections (scenario card vs Step 1, Step 1 vs Step 2, etc.) so it reads as distinct modules.
* Use consistent corner radii and shadows across all cards; right now the visual density in the trade-offs table area feels slightly different from the left.
* Consider slightly increasing font size / weight for the *core* numbers (price, fit score) and decreasing for supporting labels, to guide the eye.
* Make sure color contrast on all grey text against the purple/blue backgrounds passes WCAG, especially the lighter body text.

---

### Summing up

If you do nothing else, the three highest-impact moves are:

1. **Turn the lower half into a true stepper** with only one or two steps expanded at a time.
2. **Elevate “Your current design + its score”** above the dense 9-row table, with clear visual encoding of trade-offs.
3. **Unify the “Active users” control with the scenario** and make the refresher help more lightweight and optional.

Those three changes alone will make the experience feel much more guided, approachable, and “game-like” rather than like a dense worksheet.

**Confidence:** High that these changes will improve comprehension and perceived polish; medium on exact copy and visual weights since I’m inferring from a single screenshot and not seeing interactions in motion.
